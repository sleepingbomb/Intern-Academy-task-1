            Can you handle this Garlic Butter Shrimp Boil? We’re talking butter-drizzled juicy shrimp, steamy corn and potatoes, and luscious little side dishes of garlic butter for extra dunking. YUM!
        </p>

        <p>
            Hello! Here is what I think we should do:

Boil shrimp, summer sweet corn, baby red potatoes, and kielbasa sausage in a big pot.

Drain it all out and pour onto a table, platter, or big roasting pan.

And now drizzle, dunk, and double dunk them all in butter infused with garlic and thyme.

Thank you and goodnight! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Throw some garlic from the pantry into your butter bath, and maybe a few sprigs of thyme, and you are looking at a REALLY DELICIOUS weeknight dinner that feels fun, saucy, and deliciously outside of the box.

            Normally I’m just serving this to myself, my husband, and my toddler, and maybe a friend who happened to stop by, but even with my humble little homegrown crowd, it never fails to put stars in people’s eyes when you bring this out to the table and set it down with extra-dramatic flair.
            
            The butter-drizzled juicy shrimp, steamy corn and potatoes, and the luscious little side dishes of garlic butter for extra dunking is a hungry food-lover’s delight.

        <p>
            The idea of a shrimp boil came into my life when I was at a cabin this summer and my sister, who has 4 young kidlets (bless her), made dinner for my entire family of 18+ people without even breaking a sweat. What did she make? A SHRIMP BOIL. </p>

           <p> She told me that she makes it all the time at home because it’s super easy (boil everything and drizzle with butter) and her whole family loves it.
            
            And at that point I was like, why haven’t I been doing this for my whole life.</p>
            
           <p> I promptly went home and bought some Cajun seasoning and a container of Old Bay and got to work infusing my melted butter with thinly sliced garlic and a few sprigs of thyme. Why oh why oh why is it so good?</p>
